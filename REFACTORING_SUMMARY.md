- **Context Provider**: Global authentication state management
- **Modal System**: Integrated auth modal with contextual actions
- **Gated Actions**: Components that require authentication before use
- **Persistent Sessions**: localStorage-based session management
- **Action Context**: Remembers what user was trying to do before auth

### 5. User Experience Enhancements
- **Pointer Cursor**: All interactive elements now show cursor-pointer on hover
  - Updated Button component base styles
  - Updated navigation toggle buttons
  - Updated scroll-to-top button
  - Verified across all interactive components
- **Loading States**: Integrated loading indicators
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error states throughout
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support

### 6. Backend Integration Preparation
- **Type Definitions**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces in `types/business.ts`
- **Mock Data**: Structured mock data in `data/mockData.ts`
- **API-Ready Components**: All components designed for easy API integration
- **State Management**: Local state structured for easy migration to global state
- **Search & Filter Logic**: Modular functions ready for backend queries

### 7. Documentation
- **Authentication Guide**: Comprehensive guide for using auth system (`AUTHENTICATION_GUIDE.md`)
- **Component Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Integration Examples**: Practical examples for common use cases

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights
