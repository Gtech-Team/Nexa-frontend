# Responsive Design Fixes Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Max Width on Large Screens ✅

**Problem**: Content stretched across full width on 27-inch monitors making it visually unappealing.

**Solution**:

- Added `max-w-6xl lg:mx-auto` to main business profile containers
- Applied to:
  - Business profile hero section
  - Business profile tabs container

**Files Modified**:

- `src/components/business/business-profile-hero.tsx` - Added max-width to business info card
- `src/components/business/business-profile-tabs.tsx` - Added max-width to tabs container

### 2. "My History" Tab Visibility on Mobile/iPad ✅

**Problem**: Tab content was getting cut off or hard to read on smaller screens.

**Solution**:

- Improved tab responsiveness with better padding and height
- Enhanced text visibility on mobile devices
- Added `h-auto` to TabsList for flexible height
- Better spacing with `py-2 px-1 sm:px-3`

**Files Modified**:

- `src/components/business/business-profile-tabs.tsx` - Enhanced tab trigger styling

### 3. Modal Transparency Issue ✅

**Problem**: Negotiation modal and other modals were transparent, showing content behind them.

**Solution**:

- Changed modal overlay opacity from `bg-black/50` to `bg-black/80` for better backdrop
- Explicitly set modal content background to `bg-white` instead of `bg-background`
- Added stronger shadow (`shadow-2xl`) for better visual separation

**Files Modified**:

- `src/components/ui/dialog.tsx` - Updated DialogOverlay and DialogContent styling

### 4. Mobile Responsiveness Improvements ✅

**Problem**: Various elements not properly responsive on all screen sizes.

**Solutions Applied**:

#### Hero Section

- Responsive text sizes: `text-lg sm:text-xl lg:text-2xl`

- Better text sizes: `text-xs sm:text-sm` and `text-base sm:text-lg`

### 5. Service Buttons Clustering on Mobile ✅

**Problem**: Book and Negotiate buttons were touching each other on mobile.

**Solution**:

- Changed button container to `flex-col sm:flex-row` for vertical stacking on mobile
